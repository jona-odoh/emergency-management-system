The Emergency Management System is an online platform developed using PHP and MySQL that facilitates the reporting and management of immediate incidents and emergency situations. Whether it's a vehicle accident, criminal activity, or health scare, our system provides a quick and efficient way to notify and alert the appropriate authorities and responders.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Notification:** The system employs a real-time notification mechanism, instantly alerting authorities and responders to new incident reports, ensuring swift action.

- **Categorization and Prioritization:** Incidents are automatically categorized based on type and severity, allowing responders to prioritize their actions effectively.

- **Geo-location Mapping:** The system captures and displays incident locations on a map, aiding in resource allocation and navigation for responders.

- **User Accounts:** Users can create accounts to access additional features, view their reported incidents, and receive status updates on their reports.
